# ðŸš— Real-Time Vehicle Identification and Analysis System


The project aim at utilizing a trained model to identify the number and types of vehicles passing by my house at any given moment. This endeavor will allow for a detailed analysis of traffic patterns and vehicle classifications, providing insights into the diversity and frequency of vehicular movement in the vicinity of my residence. The model will be trained to recognize various vehicle types accurately, ensuring precise data acquisition and analysis, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive understanding of local traffic conditions.
